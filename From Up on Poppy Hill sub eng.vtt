1
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,061
The pot is bubbling
The rice is steaming

2
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,272
The cutting board is standing by

3
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:51,111
The tofu is jiggly
The eggs are slippery

4
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,572
The natto is sticky as can be

5
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,743
Drop the eggs in a frying pan

6
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,288
Stir the miso in a pot

7
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,292
Pile the rice in a server

8
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,838
Everything is ready to go

9
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,633
Time to wake up the house

10
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,470
Get everyone to the table

11
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,516
Now dig in, eat hearty

12
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,103
It's another sunny day

13
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,815
Another beautiful breakfast together

14
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,569
And I made it all for you

15
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,114
Hurry up, dig in now

16
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,285
But be sure to taste every bite

17
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,080
Another beautiful breakfast together

18
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,959
And I made it all for you

19
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,462
Hurry up, dig in now

20
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,091
But be sure to taste every bite

21
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,572
Morning!

22
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,658
Good morning. Is Sora up yet?

23
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,661
-Still in front of the mirror.
-Good morning.

24
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,121
Morning.

25
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,752
Night shift again?

26
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,754
And tonight too.

27
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,673
Shall I save dinner for you?

28
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,675
Yes, thanks.

29
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,886
That's real service.

30
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,890
-The hospital's short-handed.
-I got a hole in my sock!

31
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,267
Leave it by the sewing machine.

32
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,019
More holes?

33
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,480
My socks keep shrinking.

34
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,731
This is for you.

35
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,235
Pack me a jumbo lunch.

36
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,736
Don't you eat enough already?

37
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,783
-Here Riku, have my fried egg.
-All right!

38
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,160
You need it more, Dr. Hokuto.

39
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,622
Who's the doctor here?

40
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,794
You drown everything in soy sauce.

41
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,837
-I like it that way.
-Me too.

42
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,969
Breakfast is ready, Hiro.

43
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,472
Good morning, Hana.

44
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,224
Good morning.

45
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,817
-You can share your mother's.
-Thanks.

46
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,569
Can I make you some tea?

47
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,822
No thanks, I've had some.

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,536
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

49
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,207
Thanks.

50
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,215
Please go ahead, everyone.

51
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,842
Let's eat!

52
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,930
You're late.

53
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,349
I can't get my hair right.

54
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,352
You look very pretty.

55
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,857
I'm starving.

56
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,651
-Evening rounds again, Dr. Hokuto?
-Yes.

57
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,862
I don't know how you keep up this pace.

58
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,421
See you tomorrow.

59
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,547
Bye.

60
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,615
-Good morning, Tomoko.
-Morning.

61
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,618
Need a lift?

62
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,287
-Thanks, I'll walk.
-Suit yourself.

63
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:58,126
-Can you hang the laundry?
-Of course. See you this afternoon.

64
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,585
Bye, then.

65
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,433
Wait up.

66
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,940
KONAN ACADEMY

67
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,069
-There she is.
-Morning.

68
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,113
Look what's in the school paper.

69
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,950
There's a poem about you.
Who else raises flags every morning?

70
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,912
FAIR GIRL, WHY DO YOU SEND
YOUR THOUGHTS TO THE SKY?

71
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,166
THE WIND CARRIES THEM ALOFT
TO MINGLE WITH THE CROWS

72
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,419
TRIMMED WITH BLUE
YOUR FLAGS FLY AGAIN TODAY

73
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,754
See? It must be about you.

74
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,006
I guess.

75
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,425
So it's about you.

76
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,386
Try a note in a bottle next time.

77
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,139
Back off Math Club creep!

78
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,100
He practically lives at the clubhouse.

79
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,268
That's right.

80
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,270
All rise!

81
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,945
-We grabbed a table.
-See you there.

82
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,199
Who ordered the curry noodles?

83
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,203
Nobuko, over here!

84
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,706
-I'm famished.
-What, curry udon again?

85
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,252
Why not? I like it.
Anyway, you're one to talk.

86
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,962
So? I like bread.

87
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,881
Umi's lunches look so good.

88
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,217
You should try making your own.

89
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,220
I could, I just don't have enough time.

90
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
What are those guys up to now?

91
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,032
And...up!

92
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,994
One, two. One, two. One, two...

93
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,251
All right, drop the banners.

94
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,169
LATIN QUARTER
ANTI-DEMOLITION LEAGUE

95
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,754
It ripped!

96
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,257
Go.

97
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,166
Go for it!

98
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,963
Look this way, you guys.

99
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,012
That was cool.

100
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,389
Are you okay?

101
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,641
So stupid...

102
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,567
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

103
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,820
-Thanks, Tomoko.
-My pleasure.

104
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,825
That should do it.

105
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,119
Today's fish was really cheap.

106
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,748
Thanks. I think I'll deep fry it.

107
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,751
I have to see Grandmother.

108
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,344
Grandmother? It's me.

109
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,720
Come in.

110
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,861
In the black again this month.
You're managing things beautifully.

111
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,908
Only because you're covering
Tomoko's wages for us.

112
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,826
It's nothing.

113
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,580
I'd have hired her anyway,
even without the boarders.

114
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,708
But isn't this too much work for you?

115
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,712
I worry sometimes.

116
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,883
It doesn't feel so lonely
with everyone here.

117
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,551
I know. But still...

118
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,015
It makes me so sad, watching you
raise those flags every day.

119
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,520
No one knows how much
you miss your father.

120
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,980
I hope you find someone wonderful soon.

121
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,317
Then you won't need those flags anymore.

122
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,822
-Mrs. Matsuzaki?
-Come in.

123
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,826
I'm finished for the day.

124
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,327
Thank you, Tomoko.

125
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,915
I should get dinner going.

126
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,568
That was quite a stunt.

127
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,028
No kidding.

128
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,491
Some of the girls
are even starting a fan club.

129
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,409
What's his name?

130
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,287
Shun Kazama. He's a live wire.

131
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,540
-The electrician's son?
-Hiro, you're so dense.

132
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,154
‘Fair girl, why do you send
Your thoughts to the sky?’

133
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,549
Thus the Principality of Wallachia
was hemmed in...

134
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:07,429
by the Ottoman Turks and Russia,
and its territory was coveted by both.

135
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,562
SAVE OUR CLUBHOUSE FROM DEMOLITION

136
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,361
-Umi!
-Sora? What's going on?

137
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,824
I bought this for 30 yen.

138
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,829
30 yen just for that?

139
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,291
Isn't he cool?
I've got to have his autograph.

140
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,545
Please come with me.
I've never been inside the clubhouse.

141
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,089
Neither have I. I'm not going in there.

142
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,091
-Please!
-No way.

143
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,097
Come on, just this once. Come on...

144
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,478
It goes without saying
that the Constitutional Party

145
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,606
must take responsibility for their words.

146
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,609
Especially in this era
of political cabinets,

147
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,612
it is their duty to implement the policies

148
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,824
which they promised to the people
before they were appointed.

149
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,700
Ready?

150
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,999
By doing so, the cabinet
will be fulfilling its purpose.

151
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,878
-Excuse me?
-Today's spots are very distinct!

152
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,755
And they form a straight line.

153
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,382
A textbook magnetic field.

154
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,259
-Excuse me.
-What?

155
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,763
We're looking for the
school newspaper office.

156
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,307
Third floor, same room
as the Archaeology Club.

157
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,017
Thanks.

158
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,519
...losing all their trust.

159
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,608
They proclaim all sorts of policies,

160
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,446
but if you take a better look at them,
you will find

161
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,408
that these so-called policies
are meaningless and empty.

162
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,994
Don't they ever clean this place?

163
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,750
They have neither the sincerity
nor the passion

164
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,628
to implement any of them!

165
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:09,218
If you disagree with my observations,

166
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,931
it doesn't matter who you are...

167
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,099
SENIOR MATH CLUB

168
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,308
Hey.

169
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,561
Hi, we're looking for the
Archaeology Club.

170
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,815
Upstairs. Look for the Lit Club sign.

171
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,274
Thanks.

172
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,411
I THINK, THEREFORE I AM

173
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,621
At last, inquiring minds!

174
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,374
The Philosophy Club wants you.

175
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,753
New members! How long has it been?

176
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,756
My struggle was not in vain.

177
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,636
We're just heading for the
Archaeology Lit Club, actually.

178
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,974
Now don't be shy.
Shall we discuss existentialism?

179
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,393
Or perhaps you prefer Nietzsche?

180
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,733
Chem Club! How dare you
disturb our contemplation?

181
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,611
Better run, you guys.
You'll be there all day.

182
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,115
Show some respect,
you second-rate alchemists.

183
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,036
At least we do experiments.
Your ideas can't even be proved.

184
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:22,666
‘New poets! Draw energy
from clouds, light, storms...’

185
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,336
‘Show us the direction
humanity should take...’

186
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,590
‘A Copernicus for a new age,
to set us free...’

187
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,759
CQ! CQ!

188
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,595
This is a high school student from Japan.

189
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,997
LITERATURE CLUB
LATIN QUARTER WEEKLY

190
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,207
This is it.

191
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,587
Matsuzaki.

192
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,047
Yamazaki...

193
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,883
Hey, Shun! Couple of VIPs to see you.

194
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,601
Welcome to the Lit Club.
Or was it the Archaeology Club?

195
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,855
Don't tell me you're here
about that rag we publish.

196
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,650
Knock it off, Mizunuma.
Come in and close the...

197
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,448
They'll shut us down!

198
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,869
We're down to two members.
The Archaeology Club is doomed.

199
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,876
Can you sign this?

200
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,129
Do it for her, hero.

201
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,516
Thank you!

202
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,559
Your hand...

203
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,313
Just a cat scratch.
This isn't from the jump.

204
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,233
A cat...?

205
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,987
Wait, could you cut
some stencils for Shun?

206
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,492
We're all pretty busy
with the anti-demolition campaign.

207
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,119
You're the little sister?

208
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,163
Yes, I'm Sora Matsuzaki.

209
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,458
You help them, Umi.
My handwriting is terrible.

210
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,420
You're joking. Why should I...

211
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,130
PHYSICS MIDTERM FORECAST!

212
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,216
You're a junior. Got Suzuki for physics?

213
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,802
Suzuki? Yes.

214
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,096
Then you need this.

215
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,641
Mizunuma's exam forecasts
are usually spot on.

216
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,770
But not guaranteed.
Bring your own luck to the test.

217
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,608
See you at six.

218
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,653
-Shall we go?
-Oh, yes!

219
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,661
Miss Matsuzaki, I'd better see you out.

220
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,872
Our resident philosopher might ambush you.

221
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,582
Oh, thank you!

222
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,436
From here to the end.

223
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,315
NEW DICTIONARY
FRENCH - JAPANESE

224
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,577
We've got to do something.

225
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,705
Yes, for the honor of those
who went before us!

226
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,147
THE KONAN NEWSPAPER LATIN QUARTER
FREEDOM TO GROW OUT OUR HAIR!

227
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:18,151
THE KONAN NEWSPAPER
WHAT THE NEW GENERATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE

228
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,585
Meeting, Shun.

229
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,965
Care to join us, Matsuzaki?
It's the anti-demolition meeting.

230
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,758
Is it that late?

231
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,051
I finished.

232
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,054
Thanks, that really helps.

233
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,807
Meeting!

234
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:54,563
All hands on deck.
Time for today's meeting.

235
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,629
I'm home.

236
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,576
Hi, Umi.

237
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,288
I'm running late. Let's do curry.
Can you cut the vegetables?

238
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,748
Sure.

239
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,936
-I'm back.
-We were waiting.

240
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,563
Riku, I need some pork.

241
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,689
Can you run down for me?

242
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,192
What, right now?

243
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,194
Sora?

244
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,447
But the program just started.

245
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,200
You didn't ask Tomoko to get some?

246
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,911
I used it for lunches.

247
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,045
Start the rice in 10 minutes, okay?

248
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,840
Okay.

249
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,688
Shopping?

250
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,314
Sort of.

251
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,402
Hop on. Bottom of the hill, right?

252
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,448
Don't worry, my hand's okay.
I can use the brake just fine.

253
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,883
How was your meeting?

254
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,759
Still going strong.

255
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,596
But I've got curfew.

256
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,684
Did you finish printing the paper?

257
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,980
You must be kidding.
I'll do it tomorrow before school.

258
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,153
Listen, Shun. Can I ask you something?

259
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,574
That poem in the paper...

260
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,919
-You were saying?
-No, it's okay.

261
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,766
Thanks.

262
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,395
400 grams of sliced pork.

263
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,522
Two to go.

264
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,108
-Thank you.
-Here you go. 240 yen.

265
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,193
-Here.
-Thank you.

266
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,199
Come again.

267
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,076
Thanks.

268
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,702
Dig in.

269
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,290
I need energy to get home.

270
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,960
Where's your house?

271
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,587
-By the harbor.
-Gosh, that's far.

272
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,300
See you.

273
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,595
Thank you!

274
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,483
This is nice.

275
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,089
Can I come in?

276
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,176
Don't you feel well?

277
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,558
Go on ahead, Sora.

278
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,768
I'm coming in.

279
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,282
Wow...

280
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,004
I shouldn't paint at night.
The colors are all wrong.

281
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,590
It's beautiful.

282
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,509
What's this?

283
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,517
That tug goes by a lot.
I think it's answering your flags.

284
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,854
Guess you can't see the tug from there.

285
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,858
Answering my message?

286
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,826
I need food.

287
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,017
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

288
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,520
All printed up. Your handwriting's great.

289
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,106
Thanks.

290
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,691
Listen...

291
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,199
Can I help with anything else?

292
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,909
Of course.

293
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,789
But I can't stay late.

294
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,918
I'll give you some stencils.
You can transfer copy at home.

295
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,169
Thanks.

296
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,507
There's a debate after school.
Why don't you come?

297
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,094
Sorry, I'm busy today.

298
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,346
Bye.

299
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,521
Umi, wait!

300
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,273
Let's get ice cream.

301
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,399
No club meeting?

302
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,193
It was canceled for the debate.

303
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,947
Sorry, Tomoko's off today.
I have to be back early.

304
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,451
Come on everybody, the debate's starting.

305
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,369
Come on everybody...

306
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,455
RESOLVED: THE LATIN QUARTER
SHOULD BE PRESERVED!

307
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,623
Good, hold it right there.

308
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,753
This'll get rough.

309
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,762
Afternoon. Heading home?
Got some nice flounder fillets.

310
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,473
Okay, I'll take some.

311
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,226
-Your mom back yet?
-Not yet.

312
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,646
-I'll come back later!
-What's going on?

313
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,613
We've had peace for nearly 10 years.

314
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,907
The Olympics are coming soon.

315
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,076
It's a whole new era.

316
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,205
Japan is changing radically.

317
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,083
We must build a new society
on the ruins of the old.

318
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,169
A new democracy!

319
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,172
Tearing down the Latin Quarter

320
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,592
and building a new clubhouse
is a historical necessity.

321
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,844
And the students want it.

322
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,845
Umi!

323
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,764
What's happening?

324
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,265
I don't know exactly.

325
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,354
We surveyed the students
about the new clubhouse.

326
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:18,691
80 percent of the student body
want to rebuild.

327
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,403
I believe we must accept the board's plan!

328
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,910
You're like the old men
who run this country...

329
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,454
just blindly following the crowd.

330
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,957
Silence! I have the floor.

331
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,670
Who cares about percentages
when you're wrong? Blockheads!

332
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:42,674
Wait your turn!

333
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,094
Is this the tyranny of the majority?

334
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,013
You can't grasp the meaning of democracy.

335
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,316
Want to demolish something?
Demolish your own heads.

336
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,693
I have the floor!

337
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,947
Destroy the old and you
destroy our memory of the past.

338
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:10,451
Don't you care about the people
who lived and died before us?

339
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,495
There's no future for people...

340
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,832
who worship the future
and forget the past.

341
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,086
Democracy doesn't mean
you can ignore the minority.

342
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,881
Throw the anarchists out!

343
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,758
Scrum!

344
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,468
Eject them!

345
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,305
Stand fast, men!

346
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,182
Get off the stage. You're history!

347
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,982
-Yeah!
-Do something, chairman!

348
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,610
We won't back down!

349
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,167
A white flower was blooming

350
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:06,466
That day long ago
In my homeland far away

351
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:12,305
When at last we parted

352
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:18,186
You looked away
And didn't say a word

353
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,774
I remember your long braids

354
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:28,404
And the sadness in my heart

355
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,660
As that white flower bloomed

356
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:39,207
And the sadness in my heart

357
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:45,254
As that white flower bloomed

358
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,803
So what did you think?

359
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,348
It was amazing. Everybody's so passionate.

360
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,016
Debates are always like that.

361
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,395
Most everyone thinks
the clubhouse should go.

362
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,355
Mizunuma's fighting a losing battle.

363
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,023
You think?

364
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,248
Maybe you could clean the place up.

365
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,502
It's old, but it's such a nice building.

366
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:29,465
Make it like new again.
Invite the girls to come see it.

367
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,969
-Then they'll get it.
-Maybe you're right.

368
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,015
But the guys think
all that dust is part of history.

369
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,101
The physics midterm forecast
was a big hit.

370
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,979
Everybody's waiting for the math forecast.

371
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,731
Me too.

372
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,741
Thanks. You've been a big help.

373
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,077
-See you soon.
-So long.

374
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,625
Umi! Thanks.

375
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,596
Oh no...the fish!

376
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:25,063
...then everyone started singing.
The teachers were totally fooled.

377
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,655
It sounds like nothing's changed
since I graduated.

378
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:38,826
Your president Mizunuma
is my classmate's little brother.

379
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:44,624
-Was his brother a genius too?
-Sister. She's an astrophysicist.

380
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,541
Wow...

381
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,377
What's all the excitement in here?

382
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,047
-Great idea.
-This is the best.

383
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,965
I'll slice some cheese.

384
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,842
-Can I taste it?
-Sorry, too young.

385
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,846
Umi, why don't we invite
some Konan graduates...

386
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,014
to my farewell party?

387
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,183
Who?

388
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,769
You know...the guys.

389
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,897
Guys?

390
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,628
Hey.

391
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,051
H -O -K -U -T...

392
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,636
Hokuto.

393
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,013
You read signal flags?

394
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,564
The gate's open.

395
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,648
Coming.

396
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:07,707
Why not get married
and start a practice right here?

397
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,542
We'd have to move out!

398
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,544
You'll be married by then.

399
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,546
I'd better start looking.

400
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,299
Bet you find a real nice guy.

401
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,550
You're the best.

402
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:22,180
-The trustees are the problem.
-The principal's a good guy.

403
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,558
-He goes where the wind blows.
-The chairman's an old fox.

404
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,937
When's the principal going to quit?

405
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,566
I think we can handle them,
but we need a strategy.

406
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,696
Even with a strategy,
what can we actually do?

407
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,365
We need more glasses.

408
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,202
I'll wash some. Here, take this out.

409
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,286
All right.

410
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,584
The sushi's here.

411
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,710
Finally!

412
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:57,715
This building is 60 years old.
It used to be a hospital.

413
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,727
My great-grandfather loved cats.

414
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,233
Compared to the clubhouse,
it looks like it was built yesterday.

415
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,444
You really take good care of it.

416
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,824
So I guess your dad
must've been a doctor too?

417
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,369
No, he was a ship captain.

418
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,834
From this valley
They say you are going

419
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,673
We will miss your bright eyes
And your smile

420
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,634
Far from us
You are taking the sunshine

421
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,470
So your mom married a sailor.

422
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,099
Grandma and Grandpa
were totally against it.

423
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,642
They tried to stop her.

424
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,771
So Mom ran away and they eloped.

425
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,775
I bet that took guts.
I heard your mom's a professor.

426
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,155
And the signal flags...
Your dad taught you?

427
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,414
Yes, when I was little.

428
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:21,048
He said they helped him
find his way back to us.

429
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,009
So I raised them every day.

430
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,473
I'd raise them from the balcony
until his ship docked again.

431
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,227
I never missed a day.

432
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:40,484
Then his ship sank in the Korean War.
And that was that.

433
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,113
But I never stopped raising those flags.

434
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:53,998
After I moved here,
I wouldn't stop crying.

435
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,666
There was nowhere to raise Dad's flags.

436
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,544
So Grandpa built me that flagpole.

437
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,311
I'll open the curtains.

438
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,275
This used to be Grandpa's office.

439
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,694
Now it's my mom's study.

440
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,905
It looks like a library.

441
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,699
This is your family?

442
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,035
Yes.

443
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,120
Your father?

444
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,376
That's Grandpa. My dad's right there.

445
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,716
Isn't he handsome?
That's when they got married.

446
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,261
This is the picture I really like.

447
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,559
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

448
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,191
Yuichiro Sawamura...?

449
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,778
That's my dad. Matsuzaki is my mom's name.

450
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,823
Come on, it's speech time.

451
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,700
We better go down.

452
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,793
I'm back.

453
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,386
You're late.

454
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,806
You'll worry your mother.

455
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,487
-Shun, what about dinner?
-I already ate.

456
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,747
He swings...Nagashima strikes out!

457
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,136
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

458
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,100
Yuichiro Sawamura...

459
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,040
Thanks for coming.

460
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,042
What's going on?

461
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,553
Welcome, volunteers.
The Latin Quarter is all yours.

462
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,182
You have our deepest thanks...

463
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,686
for helping us to preserve
this magnificent cultural landmark.

464
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,779
Remember, men.
The heavy lifting is up to you.

465
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,658
Let's do it!

466
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,218
My shrine to Reason!

467
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,263
-No exceptions, that's the rule.
-Okay, ready.

468
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,639
Here we go.

469
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,266
Ready...

470
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,447
Be careful, will you?

471
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,246
Hey, watch it!

472
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,895
1st Year Math...2nd Year Math...
These are old exams.

473
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,648
We use those for forecasts.

474
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:15,235
Here's Dr. Hokuto's math final.
She got a perfect score.

475
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,666
Take over for me.
We need everything moved.

476
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,417
I'll give you a hand.

477
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,922
Heads up, Matsuzaki.

478
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:35,964
Sorry.

479
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:40,844
Mizunuma said to pitch anything
we're not sure we need.

480
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,770
It's so filthy.

481
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,647
Didn't you guys ever clean?

482
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,191
Not since I've been here.

483
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,820
We better bring
the badminton girls tomorrow.

484
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,280
Please do.

485
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,397
Sora, I'm going now.

486
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,898
Okay.

487
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,568
I'll be home by dinner.

488
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:54,418
ONE STEP FORWARD

489
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,921
Did something happen?

490
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,133
Not a thing.

491
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,636
See you tomorrow.

492
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,611
Dad, can I ask you something?

493
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,281
I'm working. Make it short.

494
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,496
Yuichiro Sawamura.
He's my real father, right?

495
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,249
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

496
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,002
We've been over that.

497
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,715
You're my son.

498
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,591
It was blowing hard
the night Sawamura brought you.

499
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:11,930
He had his Family Register with him.

500
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,321
We'd just lost a child of our own.

501
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,200
Next thing I knew,
your mother was nursing you.

502
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,869
She wouldn't let you go.

503
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,460
Sawamura was a good sailor.

504
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,340
His supply ship sank
during a battle in the Korean War.

505
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,635
Until the end, he helped us out.

506
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,889
You remind me of him more every day.

507
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,351
But you're still our son.

508
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,605
Thanks, Dad.

509
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,173
Is it out there?

510
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,508
Not yet.

511
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,979
Guess it's not coming by today.

512
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:23,186
THE LATIN QUARTER REBORN!

513
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,532
May I...?

514
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,701
Come in, Umi.

515
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,499
You're really leaving.

516
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,501
Thanks for all your help.

517
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:51,173
-I wish I could see you off.
-Go on, I'll be fine.

518
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,341
We'll miss you.

519
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,138
I'll drop by now and then.
You'd better get to school.

520
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,436
Good luck with Shun.

521
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,568
Take care.

522
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,463
Extra, extra!

523
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,881

526
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:41,223
-Latin Quarter gets a facelift!
-Extra, extra!

527
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,182

528
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,851
-I'll be there again today.
-Thanks.

529
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,479
Hi. You're working hard.

530
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,232
Hey, see you there, okay?

531
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,983
Here, Matsuzaki.

532
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,487

537
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,047
Okay.

538
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,344
NI-2 KOKUBUNJI RUINS

539
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,429
He's so brave.

00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,107
-This is great.
-Let's go look.

541
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,958
KONAN ACADEMY

542
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,609
If you don't like me, just say so.

543
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,033
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

544
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,540
Yuichiro Sawamura. He's my real father.

545
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,669
It's like some cheap melodrama.

546
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,174
I don't understand.

547
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:43,261
Dad told me years ago.
I even checked at City Hall.

548
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,596
But then...

549
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,099
We're brother and sister.

550
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,064
What should we do?

551
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:58,068
We forget whatever it was
we felt about each other.

552
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,574
We'll just be friends, like before.

553
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,519
Sora, did something happen
to Umi at school?

554
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,523
No, at least I don't think so.

555
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,817
Are you sure?

556
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,403
That dinner tonight was pretty strange.

557
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,363
And she was soaked.

558
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:49,327
Something must've happened.
She's never come home that late.

559
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,963
Umi, the bath's ready.

560
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,424
Not tonight.

561
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,260
Don't you feel well?

562
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,639
Umi...

563
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:53,892
Umi...

564
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,478
Umi...

565
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,230
Umi...

566
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,990
Good morning, Umi. Did you sleep well?

567
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,494
Mom? When did you come back?

568
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,748
Don't be silly. I've been here all along.

569
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:04,587
Umi, I'm hoisting the flags.
Come give me a hand.

570
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,520
Dad...?

571
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,525
I'll be home for a long time.

572
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,540
You're such a big girl now.

573
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,556
Need more supplies? Just ask this guy.

574
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,099
He's in construction.

575
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:25,353
-Come on, no more freebies.
-Why not? Business is good.

576
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,357
-Hope you guys win.
-Thank you.

577
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,025
Unbelievable.

578
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,362
We owe this to Dr. Hokuto.
No, even more to Umi.

579
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,448
She's our goddess of good luck.

580
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,450
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

581
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,705
This is practically a construction site.

582
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,965
What are you doing?

583
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,593
Give me that for a sec.

584
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,179
Let me show you how the pros do it.

585
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,399
Incredible!

586
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:14,193
My dad's a plasterer.

587
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,237
Beautiful...

588
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,156
What's that?

589
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,657
The wall, I mean.

590
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:20,992
What?

591
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,499
Hey.

592
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,335
That's it for today.

593
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,757
Thanks for staying late.
You don't have to go back?

594
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:40,261
Sora's covering for me.
Can I help out with anything?

595
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,310
Could you do this?

596
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,857
Can I have two days?

597
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,152
That'll really help, thanks.

598
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,196
-See you.
-So long.

599
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,719
LATIN QUARTER

600
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:33,439
VISIT THE NEW LATIN QUARTER!

601
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:45,451
MAJORITY OF GIRLS OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

602
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:57,463
MIDTERM RESULTS ANNOUNCED
TEST FORECAST VINDICATED!

603
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,472
MAJORITY OF ALL STUDENTS
OPPOSE DEMOLITION!

604
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,529
Ready, everybody?

605
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,058
Umi, don't go.

606
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,978
Shun, it's bad news.

607
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,023
The board just voted to tear us down.

608
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,987
The principal won't listen to reason.

609
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,906
All our hard work!

610
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:09,202
-They won't even come?
-Then they'd have to back down.

611
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,161
Right!

612
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,080
Mob the principal's office!

613
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,708
Let's go straight to the chairman.

614
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:20,630
Of the Tokumaru Foundation?
He's pretty hard to see.

615
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:24,258
You guys go see him. Tell him how it is.

616
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,552
Yes, please go.

617
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,597
Mizunuma, we've got to go to Tokyo.

618
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,308
Please!

619
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:34,685
Please, Mizunuma!

620
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,274
It's worth a shot. Umi, we need you too.

621
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,402
Tell him, Umi!

622
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,706
Umi, good luck tomorrow.

623
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,518
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

624
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,395
Did you skip class?

625
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,648
No, I told them yesterday I'd be absent.

626
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,943
Then we'd better get going.

627
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:42,044
FOR A SUCCESSFUL OLYMPICS
MAKE TOKYO BEAUTIFUL

628
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,073
Let's give it our best shot.

629
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,162
Yes, that's what they say.

630
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,206
No appointment?

631
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,667
We're appealing directly to Mr. Tokumaru.

632
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,462
Something about a direct appeal.

633
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,590
Yes, students from Konan Academy.

634
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,592
Three of them.

635
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,219
All right.

636
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:37,934
Take the elevator
to the fourth floor and wait there.

637
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,019
Fourth floor.

638
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,189
Don't forget to sign in. One name is fine.

639
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,076
Are you the Konan students?

640
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,577
Yes.

641
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,122
The president's very busy.

642
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,501
I can't guarantee he'll have time for you.

643
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,503
We're sorry to disturb him.

644
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:09,507
We didn't think he'd agree
to an appointment.

645
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,179
You may just be wasting your time...

646
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,515
but please wait here if you like.

647
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,142
We'll wait!

648
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,021
Oh come on, Kimura has the best pastries.

649
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,773
Nakamura's hard to beat.

650
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:29,694
I can't believe you'd say that.
You don't know your pastries.

651
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,409
Thank you.

652
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,148
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

653
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,193
ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT

654
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,871
Come on in, kids.

655
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:23,664
Thank you.

656
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,335
Excuse us.

657
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:33,257
Yeah? Ah, yeah. Hang on.

658
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,426
Have a seat.

659
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,511
Be with you in a minute.

660
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:42,850
So you see how it is.
Yes, give him my regards.

661
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,227
Okay. Bye.

662
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,151
Sit.

663
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,362
Now, why aren't you kids in school?

664
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,655
We escaped.

665
01:07:57,364 --> 01:08:00,785
Escaped? I did that a lot myself.

666
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,455
You're here about
your clubhouse, I suppose.

667
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:09,710
Yes, we'd like to ask you
to come and inspect it yourself.

668
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,462
You're welcome any time.

669
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,049
What year are you?

670
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:18,886
I'm a junior. Umi Matsuzaki.

671
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:21,055
I help out with the school paper.

672
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,184
What do you care about that old shack?

673
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:27,937
We all love it.

674
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:32,441
We spent hours making it look new.
Please see for yourself.

675
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,403
You cleaned it up?

676
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,824
What does your father do?

677
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,328
He was a ship captain in the Korean War.

678
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,622
His ship hit a mine.

679
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:20,865
A supply ship?

680
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,867
Yes.

681
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:25,327
I see.

682
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:30,249
It must've been hard
for your mother, raising you alone.

683
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,877
She did a fine job.

684
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,379
Thank you.

685
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,883
All right, I'll go.

686
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,720
TRUTH, GOODNESS AND BEAUTY

687
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:44,013
Thank you!

688
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,892
It's me.

689
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,351
What's on tomorrow?

690
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,479
Let's see, that's in the evening.

691
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,524
Move the rest to Friday.

692
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,778
It's settled. Tomorrow afternoon.

693
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,782
I'll contact your principal
and do an official inspection tour.

694
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:12,416
-Some grownups are pretty cool.
-Don't count your chickens.

695
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,628
I'm glad we came.

696
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,675
I have to swing by my uncle's place.
See you tomorrow.

697
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,548
What are you doing after graduation?

698
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,261
I can't afford much tuition.
I'll apply to a national university.

699
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,429
What about the Weekly?

700
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:11,475
I'll find somebody to take over
after things are settled.

701
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:12,893
What about you?

702
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,480
I haven't decided.

703
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:19,650
I'd like to be a doctor, though.

704
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,412
Are you the one who wrote that poem?

705
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:37,042
I saw you raising your flags
every morning from my dad's tug.

706
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:41,422
I can't see the tug passing by
from the garden.

707
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:46,176
That's why I never noticed
you were answering me.

708
01:11:58,772 --> 01:11:59,815
Shun?

709
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,903
Listen, I...

710
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:10,993
Those flags were a message to my dad.

711
01:12:11,243 --> 01:12:15,414
I think he sent you to me.
That's what I want to believe.

712
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,421
I'm in love with you, Shun.

713
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:23,881
Umi...

714
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,259
Even if we're related,
even if you're my brother...

715
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,886
my feelings will never change.

716
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:40,481
I feel the same about you.

717
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,252
I'm back.

718
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,051
Let's try it.

719
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,094
Mom!

720
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,471
Umi, I'm home.

721
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,891
Finally! How was America?

722
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,685
I was busy learning every day.

723
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,772
Any boyfriends yet, Sora?

724
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,023
Not yet.

725
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,609
This is great stuff, Mom.

726
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,319
It's called jerky.

727
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:28,862
Is it pork?

728
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:31,740
Hiro, it says beef on the package.

729
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:44,378
Mom?

730
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,716
You're up pretty late.

731
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,223
I wanted to ask you something.

732
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,933
Ask away, then.

733
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,274
I'm wide awake.

734
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,861
Sorting through these books
woke me up even more.

735
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,739
There's this boy at school.
His name is Shun Kazama.

736
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,412
He came for the farewell party.

737
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,915
I showed him Dad's picture.
He had the same photo.

738
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,252
He says his real father
is Yuichiro Sawamura.

739
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,148
This one?

740
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,650
SAWAMURA YUICHIRO,
TACHIBANA HIROSHI, ONODERA YOSHIO

741
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:56,200
I'm afraid this is all
a little bit complicated.

742
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,288
I told you about how
your father and I eloped.

743
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,458
You remember, don't you?

744
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,921
Our first place
was that second-floor apartment.

745
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:12,674
Yuichiro was away a lot.

746
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:17,846
I was pregnant with you
and working on my degree.

747
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,851
I loved school so much.
I was determined to do well.

748
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,452
Yuichi...

749
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:43,914
Yuichiro, whose baby is that?

750
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,417
It's Tachibana's boy. He's ours now.

751
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:53,840
Tachibana was killed in an accident
on a repatriation ship.

752
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:57,678
His wife died giving birth.
The Bomb killed their relatives.

753
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:02,766
If we don't register him as ours,
he'll end up in an orphanage.

754
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:10,941
Yuichiro registered the baby
as his son and brought him home.

755
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:15,445
The war had just ended.
It was happening everywhere.

756
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:21,702
But I was already pregnant.
There was no way I could raise him.

757
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:26,707
Yuichiro's friend lost a child,
so we gave the baby up.

758
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,711
Is he doing well?

759
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,007
I'm so glad.

760
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:40,470
Your father was so good-hearted.
Maybe just a little impulsive.

761
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,975
Without his help,
I couldn't have finished school.

762
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:51,648
But what if Shun was really Dad's son?

763
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:54,693
If he was really Yuichiro's son?

764
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:56,862
I'd like to meet him.

765
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,656
Does he look like this picture?

766
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,002
Umi...

767
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:48,830
See you tonight.

768
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,082
Have a nice day.

769
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,605
Welcome to the Latin Quarter.

770
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:14,583
LATIN QUARTER WELCOMES CHAIRMAN TOKUMARU

771
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:25,135
I never realized this building
was so impressive.

772
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,845
Thank you, sir.

773
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,891
What are you studying?

774
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:34,895
Sir! The Astronomy Club
has studied sunspots for 10 years.

775
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:39,149
10 years? And what did you discover?

776
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:43,820
The sun is very old,
and our lifespan is short.

777
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,071
No discoveries so far!

778
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,574
Excellent answer.

779
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:51,077
I THINK, THEREFORE I AM

780
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:55,999
The Philosophy Club?

781
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,045
Wouldn't you like a brand new clubhouse?

782
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:03,632
What about your junior members?

783
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,136
Sir, we philosophers
can be content with just a barrel.

784
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:09,971
Diogenes! Very good.

785
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:18,146
Principal, your students
are really quite impressive.

786
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,651
-Shun Kazama?
-Yes.

787
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,034
Hello, Dad?

788
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:33,870
The third man in the photo is here.

789
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,039
He can tell you about your father.

790
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:40,502
His ship leaves at four o'clock.

791
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:44,172
He won't be back for months.
Get down here!

792
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:59,980
Should the world sink

793
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:04,442
Beneath the indigo waves

794
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:09,489
Stand fast, sink not

795
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:14,411
Beneath that horizon

796
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:19,291
Stand fast against the flood

797
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:23,545
Like a great range of mountains

798
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:28,174
With pinnacles thrust high

799
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:32,679
Into the winds of the future

800
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:38,393
Should the world sink

801
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:42,147
Beneath the indigo waves

802
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,693
Stand fast, sink not

803
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:51,406
Beneath that horizon

804
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:58,038
My friends, you have shown me
the Latin Quarter's true value.

805
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:01,791
How can we educate the young
without protecting our culture?

806
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,423
I'll just find a different site
for the new building.

807
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:13,428
All right!

808
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:16,056
Umi, you did it.

809
01:22:16,139 --> 01:22:17,432
We all did it.

810
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,352
Awesome! Magnificent!

811
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:26,441
SENIOR MATH CLUB

812
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:29,194
On to the next experiment.

813
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,739
Umi, we owe this to you.

814
01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:36,117
But I didn't do anything special.

815
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,079
Fixing things up was your idea.

816
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:39,996
She's right.

817
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,998
Thank you, Umi.

818
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:43,333
Thank you!

819
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:46,211
Good for you. Umi.

820
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,922
Umi!

821
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,972
The perfect couple.

822
01:22:58,556 --> 01:22:59,557
Please excuse them, sir.

823
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:03,228
Something very important
is happening to both of them.

824
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,230
They have to hurry.

825
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:09,442
Escape... It's great to be young.

826
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,529
KONAN ACADEMY

827
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:15,115
Shun!

828
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,075
Give us a ride.

829
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:19,995
Umi?

830
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:32,799
Don't worry Umi,
I'll get you there in time.

831
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,395
We'd better run.

832
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:46,855
Thanks!

833
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:50,233
Good luck, Umi.

834
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:00,243
Come on, Shun. Hurry!

835
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:02,829
Thanks.

836
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,985
That's my dad's tug.

837
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,806
Here they are, captain.

838
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,734
Push our departure back 15 minutes.

839
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:22,784
So you're Tachibana's boy.

840
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,746
And you must be Sawamura's daughter.

841
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,498
Both fine-looking youngsters.

842
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,432
It's Shun, right?

843
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:49,394
Your father was Hiroshi Tachibana.

844
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:52,480
Front row, fourth from the right.

845
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:55,650
You can see Sawamura next to him.

846
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:58,528
We three were close friends.

847
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:02,657
Take the seat of honor, Tachibana.

848
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:03,867
Why me?

849
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:06,077
You're our leader. You belong there.

850
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,496
All right, let's do it.

851
01:26:11,624 --> 01:26:13,918
Just don't die before me, okay?

852
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:16,212
Same goes for you.

853
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,423
Here we go.

854
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:35,064
I was away at sea
when your parents passed on.

855
01:26:35,815 --> 01:26:39,068
Otherwise I'd have done
exactly what Sawamura did.

856
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:44,866
Meeting you two
is like seeing my old friends again.

857
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:48,328
Thank you both. I've never been so happy.

858
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:46,899
THE END
