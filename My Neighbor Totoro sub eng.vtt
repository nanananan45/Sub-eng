1
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,492
Dad, do you want some candy?

2
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,036
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

3
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,038
- No.
- We're almost there.

4
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,885
Mei, hide!

5
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,225
It wasn't a policeman.

6
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,019
Hello!

7
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,761
Hello. Are your parents around?

8
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,097
Thanks.

9
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,103
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

10
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,023
A pleasure to meet you!

11
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,943
Welcome!

12
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,531
Thank you.

13
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,972
Here we are!

14
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,808
Wait!

15
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,272
- Mei, there's a bridge!
- A bridge?

16
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,654
See that flash? Fish too!

17
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,240
So, you like it here?

18
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,245
Dad, it's terrific!

19
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,038
Look, a tunnel of trees!

20
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,710
Is that our house?

21
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,465
Come on!

22
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,355
It's a wreck!

23
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,898
Wreck!

24
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,318
- Looks like a haunted house!
- Haunted?

25
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,327
And it's all rotten!

26
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,423
It's gonna fall down!

27
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,675
Fall down!

28
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,103
Look, Mei!

29
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,690
See?

30
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,785
It's huge.

31
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,001
Dad, there's a huge tree!

32
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,504
It's a camphor tree.

33
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,883
- Camphor tree!
- Camphor tree!

34
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,143
Oops!

35
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,688
An acorn!

36
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,567
Show me.

37
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,778
Another one!

38
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,369
It's mine.

39
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,794
Out of the way. I can't open the screens.

40
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,796
Acorns!

41
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,173
There are acorns in the house.

42
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,550
They fell from up there!

43
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,057
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

44
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,059
Squirrels, really?

45
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,937
Or rats; they like acorns too.

46
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,565
I'd rather have squirrels!

47
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,067
Where shall I put this?

48
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:28,114
Here, I'll get the door for you.
Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

49
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,115
Okay.

50
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,033
It's just round the back.

51
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,328
Mei, come on!

52
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,081
Wait for me!

53
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,376
Hurry!

54
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,540
Ready?

55
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,054
Bathtubs.

56
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,394
There's nothing here.

57
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,065
That's the bathroom.

58
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,942
Dad, there's something in here.

59
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:46,943
A squirrel?

60
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,948
Dunno. A bunch of black things,
but not roaches or mice.

61
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,241
Really?

62
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,128
Can you see them?

63
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,257
I think they were dust bunnies.

64
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,260
Dust bunnies? Like in my picture book?

65
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,055
That's right.
Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

66
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,604
When you walk into
a dark room from outside,

67
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,732
your eyes dim
and the dust bunnies come out.

68
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,442
Oh, I see.

69
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,238
Come here, dust bunnies.

70
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,408
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

71
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:45,293
Let's get to work!
See if you can find how to get upstairs.

72
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,839
Get up there and open all the windows.

73
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,382
Sure!

74
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,092
I'm coming, too!

75
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,019
Toilet!

76
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,564
Not here!

77
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,694
- Not here!
- Not here!

78
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,283
- Not here!
- Not here!

79
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,163
Not here!

80
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,333
Nothing here!

81
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,251
Nothing!

82
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,263
Mei, it's here!

83
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,355
It's pitch black!

84
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,273
Dust bunnies...

85
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,908
Another acorn.

86
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,959
Come out, dust bunnies!

87
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,002
Are you there, Mr. Dust Bunny?

88
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,776
One, two...

89
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,236
One, two...

90
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,699
Dad, there's definitely something here!

91
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,242
That's exciting!

92
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,913
I've always wanted to live
in a haunted house.

93
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,498
Oh, no!

94
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,168
I'm coming!

95
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,882
I got it. Satsuki!

96
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,563
Mei.

97
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,201
You're full of energy!

98
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,872
This is Nanny.
She has come to look after the house.

99
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,793
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

100
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,587
Nice to meet you both.

101
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,507
I'd have cleaned up

102
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,261
if I'd known you'd be this quick.

103
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,721
No, you've done plenty.

104
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,224
I've been so busy in the rice paddies,

105
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,227
I only did a bit of dusting...

106
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,481
What have you done to your hands?

107
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,775
The dust bunny got away.

108
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,610
Your feet, too!

109
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,825
Mine are black, too!

110
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,873
Well, well, well.

111
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,086
That must be the soot spreaders.

112
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,881
Those little, black,

113
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,467
fuzzy things that fly?

114
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,389
That's right.
They breed in empty old houses,

115
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,976
and cover them with soot and dust.

116
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,230
I could see them when I was little.

117
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,610
Now you can too, huh?

118
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,069
Are they like goblins?

119
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,532
No, nothing so scary.

120
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:14,163
If you keep smiling,
they'll soon leave the house.

121
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,835
They're probably deciding
where to go next, right now.

122
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,760
Mei, they're going away.

123
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,844
That's no fun.

124
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,347
What happens if a huge one
comes out, like this?

125
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,057
I wouldn't be scared.

126
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,061
Okay then, I won't walk you
to the bathroom at night.

127
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:44,568
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get
some water from the stream?

128
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,987
- From the stream?
- I'm coming, too!

129
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,117
Mei, wait there.

130
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,462
Did you get a fish?

131
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,184
Nanny, it's coming out!

132
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:22,189
Good, keep pumping
'til the water gets cold.

133
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,774
Okay!

134
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,819
May I help you?

135
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,823
Huh... my mom... for Granny.

136
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,076
Yes?

137
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,834
Wait, what is it?

138
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,545
Is that you, Kanta?

139
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:33,635
You live in a haunted house!

140
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,137
Kanta, stop it!

141
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,983
I did the same kind of thing
when I was his age.

142
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,655
I hate boys.
But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

143
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,033
Eat as much as you want.

144
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,160
Thank you!

145
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,082
Thank you so much for your help.

146
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,418
Goodbye!

147
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,329
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

148
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,543
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

149
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,748
Come on, let's laugh to keep
the bogeymen away!

150
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,835
I'm not scared.

151
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,880
I mean it. I'm not scared!

152
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,510
One, two...

153
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,597
Come on, keep up the good work.

154
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,772
Okay! Washing, finished!

155
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,242
Here we go!

156
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,803
Nanny!

157
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,472
Hello!

158
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,974
Hard at work?

159
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,269
Where are you all heading?

160
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,938
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

161
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,818
That's nice. Give her my regards!

162
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,903
Okay!

163
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,963
This way.

164
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,284
- Hello.
- Hello there.

165
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,370
Mommy!

166
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,873
So glad you came, my dear.

167
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,375
Daddy took the wrong road.

168
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,212
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

169
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,047
It's a school holiday, today.

170
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,590
How nice.

171
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,218
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

172
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,178
It's so good to see you all.

173
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,348
Have you settled into the new house?

174
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,064
A haunted house?

175
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,817
Mom, do you like ghosts?

176
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,570
Of course I do! I can't wait to see them.

177
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,030
See, I told you, Mei.

178
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,701
Mei was worried that
you wouldn't like ghosts.

179
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,994
What about you two?

180
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,831
- I love them!
- I'm not scared of them!

181
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,961
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

182
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,506
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

183
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,260
But she always gets mad at me.

184
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,095
'Cause you won't stay still.

185
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,013
Come here, Satsuki.

186
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,474
Isn't yours too short?

187
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,268
No, I like it like this.

188
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,770
- Do mine, Mommy. Mine, too.
- Wait your turn!

189
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:04,317
Wavy hair, just like mine
when I was your age.

190
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,280
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

191
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,325
Probably. You take after your mom.

192
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,220
Mom looked really well.

193
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:36,016
You're right.
The doctor says she'll be home soon.

194
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,268
Soon? Like tomorrow?

195
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,854
You always say that.

196
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,480
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

197
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,234
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.

198
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,780
Weren't you saying
you're big enough to sleep alone?

199
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,741
Mom is special!

200
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,891
Dad, time to get up!

201
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,105
Wake up!

202
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,238
Sorry, I overslept again.

203
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,156
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

204
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,533
I totally forgot about it.

205
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,745
It's all right.
I've made something for all of us.

206
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,455
- It's burning.
- Let me do it.

207
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,252
Here, this is yours, Mei.

208
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,629
It's for me!

209
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,965
Mei, sit down and eat!

210
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,174
Okay.

211
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,469
Here, wrap yours.

212
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,183
Satsuki!

213
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,479
Uh-oh. I'm coming!

214
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,899
You made a friend already?

215
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,901
She's calling you!

216
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,945
Yeah, that's Michiko.

217
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,782
Gotta go!

218
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,785
See you!

219
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,162
Have a good day!

220
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,957
Morning!

221
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,084
Hi, let's go.

222
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,254
- Hi!
- Good morning!

223
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,848
Daddy!

224
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,059
Do I look all grown up?

225
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,103
Yes, dear. Where are you going?

226
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,896
I'm just going out.

227
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,504
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

228
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,465
Already?

229
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,271
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

230
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,997
Pole-tads!

231
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,143
Got no bottom.

232
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,825
Gotcha!

233
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,414
Who are you? A big dust bunny?

234
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,612
To-to-ro? You're Totoro!

235
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,869
I bet you're Totoro.

236
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,790
Totoro.

237
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,985
- See you!
- Okay, catch you later!

238
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,280
I'm home!

239
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,158
Hey there. Is it that late already?

240
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,201
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

241
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,580
We haven't eaten yet.
Is Mei in the garden?

242
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,831
Mei!

243
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,417
Mei!

244
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,961
Mei!

245
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,299
Mei!

246
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,434
Dad, I found her hat!

247
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,409
Mei?

248
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,377
Wake up, Mei!

249
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,048
You shouldn't sleep here!

250
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,385
- Where's Totoro?
- Totoro?

251
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,888
Where?

252
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,892
Were you dreaming?

253
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,810
Totoro was here.

254
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,022
You mean that troll in your picture book?

255
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,027
Yeah. He was all hairy

256
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,571
with a big mouth like this.

257
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:27,245
There's a tiny one and a little one
and a huge one like this.

258
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,502
There you are.

259
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,837
What a great hiding place.

260
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,091
Dad, Mei said she saw a Totoro here.

261
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,676
A Totoro?

262
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,261
It's this way.

263
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,312
Hey, wait for me!

264
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
It's here.

265
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,195
- Is it?
- No.

266
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,156
It went to a big tree.

267
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,242
But there wasn't any other path.

268
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,453
Come back, Mei!

269
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,914
Mei! Come back!

270
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,097
But it's true! Totoro was here.

271
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:29,932
I'm not lying.

272
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,234
I know, Mei.

273
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,528
I didn't lie.

274
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,950
Neither of us think you're lying.

275
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:51,245
You probably met the king of this forest.

276
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,914
You were very lucky.

277
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,293
He doesn't come out very often.

278
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,547
We should go to the shrine
to pay our respects.

279
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,467
- Pay our respects?
- To this forest.

280
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,944
Mei, you're getting heavy.

281
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,529
Dad, look! The camphor tree!

282
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,907
What a big tree.

283
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,541
It's here!

284
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,960
Is that the tree?

285
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,963
Dad, hurry up.

286
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,976
The hole has gone.

287
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,353
Are you sure it was here?

288
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,065
The hole disappeared.

289
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,484
I told you that
he doesn't come to see us often.

290
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,278
But will he come again?
I want to meet him, too.

291
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,782
If you're lucky, sure.

292
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,952
What a beautiful tree.

293
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,999
This tree must have stood here
for years and years.

294
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,088
Trees and people used to be good friends.

295
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:29,135
I saw that tree
and decided to buy the house.

296
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,179
I hope Mom likes it too.

297
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,516
Okay, let's pay our respects,
then get home for lunch.

298
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,436
Oh yeah, I promised to go see Michiko!

299
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,770
I want to go, too!

300
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,188
Attention!

301
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:46,402
Thank you for looking after Mei.

302
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,446
Thank you very much!

303
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,199
- Last one home's a rotten egg!
- That's not fair! Dad!

304
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,785
Wait!

305
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,080
Hurry up!

306
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,416
Wait for me!

307
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,379
<i>Dear Mother,
something amazing happened today.</i>

308
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,216
<i>Mei met a giant Totoro.</i>

309
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,684
<i>And I'm hoping to see him
myself soon, too.</i>

310
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,343
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

311
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,344
Coming...

312
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,976
WAIT, RIVER, PINE TREE

313
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:17,743
Well, well!

314
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,137
Mei?

315
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,474
- Excuse me!
- Yes, Satsuki?

316
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,810
It's my sister...

317
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,605
- Sister?
- Where?

318
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,860
What happened, Nanny?

319
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:56,365
I'm sorry.
She insisted that she be with you.

320
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:01,412
It's Dad's day at the university.

321
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,456
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

322
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,714
I still have two more classes
and Nanny's too busy for this.

323
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:16,635
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?

324
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,645
I'll go talk to my teacher.

325
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:37,489
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital,

326
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,783
I want you all to be nice to her.

327
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,160
Yes, Miss!

328
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,709
What's that?

329
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,918
It's Totoro.

330
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,590
- Mei, you should keep quiet.
- Okay.

331
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,642
See you!

332
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,353
Bye-bye, Mei!

333
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,272
I can't stay after class today.

334
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,524
- We'll let teacher know.
- See you!

335
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,655
- Hurry up, it's going to rain!
- Okay.

336
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,164
Here it comes!

337
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,260
Here.

338
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,351
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

339
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,438
It's getting worse.

340
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,111
Dear Guardian Spirit,
let us stay until the rain stops.

341
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:41,905
But...

342
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,428
That was lucky.

343
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,806
It's got holes in it.

344
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,862
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

345
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,572
I'm going, too.

346
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,994
I said I forgot it!

347
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,247
What idiot forgets his umbrella
on a rainy day?

348
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,208
Ouch!

349
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,793
You broke it playing, I bet.

350
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,961
I did not!

351
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,935
Excuse me.

352
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,857
Hello, Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

353
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,902
I'm sorry about Mei today.

354
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,654
Not at all. Sorry we couldn't do more.

355
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,407
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

356
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,994
He did? A broken old thing like that!

357
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,830
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

358
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,376
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

359
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,381
Not at all.
It probably cleaned him up a little.

360
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,217
- Are you off to meet your father?
- Yes.

361
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,677
What good girls you are.

362
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,846
- Bye-bye, Mei.
- Bye-bye.

363
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,943
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

364
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,241
Just in time!

365
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:58,542
DESTINATION MAEZAWA, INARIMAE STATION
TOKYO ELECTRIC RAILWAY BUS

366
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,672
Getting on?

367
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,883
All right, drive on.

368
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,345
TOKYO BUS COMPANY

369
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,603
Daddy wasn't on it.

370
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:21,732
He'll be on the next one.
Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

371
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,102
Are you okay?

372
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,012
Are you sleepy?

373
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,850
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

374
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,729
Not much longer. Hang on.

375
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,405
It's late...

376
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,414
Come on.

377
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,123
Are you Totoro?

378
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,010
Wait a minute.

379
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,017
You can use this.

380
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,521
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

381
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,529
Hold it like this.

382
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:13,732
Here's the bus!

383
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,123
TSUKAMORI

384
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,020
INFIRMARY

385
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,636
He took Daddy's umbrella.

386
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,734
I'm sorry.

387
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:40,694
Drive on.

388
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:44,572
The train was late and I missed the bus.

389
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,950
Were you worried?

390
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,953
We met him, Dad! He was here!

391
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,579
And the cat bus!

392
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,081
What?

393
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,291
It was huge!

394
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:59,087
With big eyes like this!

395
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:04,259
We met him! We met Totoro!

396
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,886
How wonderful!

397
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,065
Come on, Daddy.

398
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:31,077
<i>Dear Mother, I can't tell you
how excited I was today.</i>

399
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:35,206
<i>It was the scariest,
funniest day I've ever had.</i>

400
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,710
<i>Totoro gave us a lovely present</i>

401
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:43,048
<i>wrapped in bamboo leaves
and tied with dragon whiskers.</i>

402
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:48,344
<i>When we opened it,
it was full of magic nuts and seeds!</i>

403
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:58,104
"We decided to plant them in the garden
to make a lovely forest."

404
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,149
<i>But they haven't sprouted yet.</i>

405
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:05,695
<i>Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.</i>

406
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:10,658
<i>She looks like a little crab.</i>

407
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,951
CRAB MEI

408
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,791
<i>It's nearly summer vacation.</i>

409
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,961
<i>Dearest, dear Mom,
get well soon. Love, Satsuki.</i>

410
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,509
Come on. Bed time.

411
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,431
- Lights off!
- Wait, Dad.

412
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,018
Daddy, do you think they will
come out tomorrow?

413
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:41,231
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know.

414
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,524
Night night.

415
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,407
Wake up, Mei!

416
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,635
That's where we planted the seeds.

417
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,771
Wow, we did it!

418
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,683
We're the wind!

419
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,870
There are no trees!

420
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,502
Yes!

421
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:02,719
- It was a dream.
- But it wasn't a dream.

422
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,805
We did it!

423
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,324
Mr. Kusakabe!

424
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,869
Telegram!

425
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,788
Mr. Kusakabe!

426
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,000
Anyone home?

427
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,050
Nanny?

428
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,723
I'm here.

429
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,727
This one is ripe.

430
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,571
What about this one?

431
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,739
That's good, too.

432
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,457
Your garden is a treasure trove.

433
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,418
Let's take a little break.

434
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,219
These should be cold now.

435
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,179
Looks delicious.

436
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,023
So good.

437
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:44,987
The sun blessed these,
so they're really good for you.

438
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,739
Would they help my mom?

439
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:52,328
Of course. If she eats my vegetables,
she'll get better right away.

440
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,581
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

441
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,542
She'll sleep in my bed!

442
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,003
At last. That's wonderful.

443
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,257
But it's only for a couple of days.

444
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,510
To get used to the new house.

445
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:12,223
I see.
We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

446
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:15,685
I'll give her this corn I picked.

447
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,812
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

448
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,355
I know.

449
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,490
There was a telegram for you.

450
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,449
For us?

451
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,039
Dad won't be back till late,
what shall I do?

452
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:40,001
Open it, it might be important.

453
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:47,758
Please contact, hospital...

454
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,429
It's from Mom's hospital!

455
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,264
Something's happened to her!

456
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,685
Nanny! What shall I do?

457
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:01,939
Calm down. Do you know where your dad is?

458
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,276
I know his office number,
but we don't have a telephone.

459
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,614
Kanta, take her to use the phone
in the main house!

460
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,246
Mei, stay here with me!

461
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,591
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

462
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,506
Hello, I'd like to make
a long-distance call.

463
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:14,345
It's Tokyo 31 1382.

464
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,849
A cute girl, Kanta.

465
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:23,646
Hello? Yes?

466
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:29,860
Hello, may I speak to Dad... Mr. Kusakabe?

467
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,655
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

468
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:38,661
Daddy? It's me, Satsuki!

469
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,413
Hello, what's wrong?

470
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:44,667
From the hospital?

471
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,795
<i>Okay, I'll call them right away.</i>

472
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:50,715
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

473
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,342
<i>Don't worry. I'll check up</i>

474
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:57,054
<i>and call you right back.</i>

475
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,266
I'll hang up now, stay there.

476
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:06,272
May I stay here until he calls back?

477
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,025
Stay as long as you like.

478
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,325
Satsuki!

479
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,171
No, this corn is for my mommy!

480
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:35,176
No, it's my mom's!

481
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:54,278
Listen, Mei. Mom's not well,

482
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:57,364
so she's not coming home this time.

483
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:58,991
No!

484
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,871
There's nothing we can do.
You don't want her to get worse, do you?

485
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,539
No!

486
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,126
It's just for a few more days.

487
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,128
No!

488
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,381
So you don't care if she dies?

489
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,383
No!

490
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,470
Stop being silly! I'm going.

491
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,440
Let's go, Mei.

492
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,572
I hate you, Satsuki!

493
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:09,019
We should bring the washing in.

494
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,606
Don't worry too much, Satsuki.

495
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:16,443
Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

496
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:24,535
Your dad said he'll stop by the hospital
to check on her.

497
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:28,038
Besides, it's just a cold;

498
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:32,042
she'll be back next week.

499
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,176
They said it was just a cold

500
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,761
when she went into hospital.

501
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,265
But what if she dies!

502
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,267
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

503
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,895
Maybe Mom will...

504
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,776
Stop it.

505
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,614
Nobody would leave
two pretty little girls like you.

506
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:06,243
There, there. Don't cry.

507
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:11,123
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

508
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:56,168
Mei!

509
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,174
Mei!

510
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,304
Mei!

511
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,767
Did she come back?

512
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,103
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

513
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,607
That's strange. Where has she gone?

514
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:22,987
I was nasty to her,
'cause she was being silly...

515
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,614
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!

516
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:28,701
The hospital?

517
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,662
It would take a grown-up three hours!

518
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:32,621
I'll go look!

519
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:37,209
Kanta, hurry!

520
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:41,297
Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

521
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,142
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

522
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,235
Mei!

523
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:12,077
Excuse me.

524
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:18,625
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
She's my sister.

525
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,086
No, I don't think so.

526
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,881
I'm sure I would've noticed.

527
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:26,759
Maybe she wasn't here.

528
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:49,698
- Are you sure she came this way?
- I don't know.

529
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,918
Mei!

530
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,690
Please, stop!

531
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:27,653
Idiot! What are you doing?

532
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:30,406
I'm looking for my sister.
Have you seen a little girl?

533
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:32,866
Your little sister?

534
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:36,286
She's four.
I think she's heading to the hospital.

535
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,664
Did you see anyone?

536
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:43,794
No. We just came from there,
but we didn't see anyone.

537
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,672
Thanks anyway.

538
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,591
Where have you come from?

539
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,801
From Matsugo.

540
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:52,344
Matsugo?

541
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,179
Really?

542
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:56,765
Good luck.

543
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,862
Satsuki!

544
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:13,657
Kanta!

545
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:17,035
- Find her?
- No. And you?

546
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,541
Dad and the others are looking for her.
I'll go to the hospital,

547
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,084
you go back home.

548
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:28,172
I guess she got lost
on the way to the hospital.

549
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,425
They found a sandal by the pond.

550
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,560
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

551
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,078
Did you find her?

552
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,989
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

553
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,034
It's too deep here,
better search further away!

554
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:40,994
Hey, are there any poles left?

555
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,214
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

556
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,095
Nanny!

557
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:01,348
Look, is it hers?

558
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:11,608
No, it isn't.

559
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:28,208
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

560
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,043
Nanny was jumping to conclusions.

561
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,379
It's not hers!

562
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,881
Where did she go then?

563
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:36,425
Let's start from scratch.

564
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,135
Hurry, before it gets dark.

565
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:41,888
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

566
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,348
It could've been any of us.

567
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,892
Someone should contact the police.

568
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,213
Please, help me, Totoro!

569
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,634
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon.

570
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,844
I'm sure she's scared somewhere.

571
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,001
Totoro!

572
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:58,840
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

573
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,843
She must be scared,

574
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,846
please help me find her.

575
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:08,475
I don't know what to do.

576
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:08,952
They can't see the bus.

577
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,043

Mei!

583
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:33,995
The trees are moving out of the way!

584
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:56,268
MEI

585
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:07,362
Mei!

586
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:13,535
Satsuki!

587
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:18,582
- Satsuki!
- Mei!

588
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,342
Mei!

589
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,219
Satsuki!

590
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,265
You silly girl.

591
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:37,058
I'm sorry.

592
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,689
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

SHICHIKOKUYAMA HOSPITAL

01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,161
Will you take us there?

595
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,707
Thank you so much.

596
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:14,471
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send
a telegram just for a cold.

597
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:19,225
The girls must be worried.
I'm sorry to upset them.

598
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,437
They'll be fine. As long as you're okay.

599
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:27,359
We've all learned to cope.
This will just postpone the enjoyment.

600
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:32,447
They've put up with it so well.

601
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,617
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki,
she's so sensitive.

602
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:37,869
You're right.

603
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:42,791
I'm going to spoil them
for a while when I come home.

604
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:43,708
Oh, no!

605
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,259
She's laughing!

606
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:54,803
Looks like she's fine.

607
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:05,855
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

608
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:06,856
Me too!

609
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:08,900
Look.

610
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:16,574
Where did that come from?

611
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:19,661
What?

612
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:23,957
I could swear I just saw Satsuki
and Mei laughing up in that tree.

613
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,170
Maybe they were. Look.

614
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:33,174
TO MOM

615
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:24,012
THE END
