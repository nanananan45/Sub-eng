1
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:24,744
September 21, 1945.
That was the night I died.

2
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,305
Damn tramps.

3
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,115
Watch it!

4
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:02,286
Disgusting!

5
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:03,747
Is he dead?

6
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:05,977
The Americans'll be arriving
any day now.

7
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:08,859
It's disgraceful,
having these bums here!

8
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,922
<i>Mama...!</i>

9
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:24,642
What day is it?

10
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:37,497
Setsuko...

11
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:49,241
Another one.

12
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,806
What is this stuff?

13
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:08,027
Never mind. Just dump it!

14
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,651
This one's a goner, too.

15
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,452
You can see it in their eyes.

16
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:42,205

22
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,938
Air raid!
Get to the shelters!

23
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,519
We're in for a big one!

24
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:03,960
The shelter behind the firehouse
should be safest!

25
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,562
It's hot!

26
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:12,543
Be a good girl.
Try to be patient.

27
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:19,995
I'd better get over to the shelter.

28
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:23,356
Be careful, and get over there
as soon as you can.

29
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:27,337
Setsuko, be a good girl
and mind your brother.

30
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,657
Never mind us!
Get to the shelter!

31
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,078
Yes, yes.

32
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,400
Mom, do you have your medicine?

33
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,770
Right here. Don't worry.

34
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,611
I hate the shelter!

35
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:46,302
Well, you'll be sorry
if you get blown up by a bomb!

36
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,633
Now get on.

37
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:55,786
My doll!

38
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,071
Air raid!

39
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,531
Nii-chan!

40
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,965
Get down!

41
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:30,855
Nii-chan!

42
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,800
Nii-chan!

43
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:45,646
Long live the Emperor!

44
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:08,962
We're safe here. Don't worry.

45
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,683
Where's Mama?

46
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:15,053
In the shelter.

47
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:20,663
The firehouse shelter can take
a hit from a 250-kilo bomb easy.

48
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:21,954
Don't worry about her.

49
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:36,464
She'll probably go to
Niponmatsu station to find us.

50
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,045
We'll meet her there.

51
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:41,494
Let's just catch our breath first.

52
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:50,296
Are you okay, Setsuko?

53
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:53,286
I lost one of my shoes.

54
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:57,386
I'll buy you better ones.

55
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,526
I have money.

56
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,216
Open this.

57
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:22,777
Wow, you're rich.

58
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,248
Black rain, from the bombing.

59
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,110
It's all gone!

60
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:22,491
Look, that was the civic hall.
I ate lunch there, once.

61
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:27,671
Is our house gone too?

62
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:29,272
Probably.

63
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:31,241
What'll we do?

64
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,742
Dad'll make them pay for this!

65
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:52,433
Mother!

66
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:06,363
Well, it's not like I was
the only one who lost his house.

67
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,523
We're all in the same boat.

68
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,785
At least we're still alive.

69
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:22,124
There were two direct hits.
The fires are impossible to put out!

70
00:13:22,164 --> 00:13:24,935
When you try to smother them,
it just spreads the oil around.

71
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,615
It's not her.
She's not down here!

72
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:35,206
Seita, I have to pee.

73
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:50,647
All residents of
Ichirizuka and Kaminishi!

74
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:56,706
Please report to the elementary
school for first aid services!

75
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:57,447
What's wrong?

76
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:59,346
My eye hurts.

77
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:00,427
Don't rub it.

78
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:04,337
We'll get it washed out
at the school.

79
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:06,828
Where's Mama?

80
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:08,097
She'll be at the school.

81
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,177
School...?

82
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,048
Uh-huh. Let's go.

83
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:29,578
Seita-san!

84
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,660
Have you seen your mom?

85
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,149
She's hurt.
You'd better go.

86
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,500
I'll watch your sister.

87
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:43,010
Wasn't that scary, Setsuko?
Did you cry?

88
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,870
Seita has to go somewhere.
Why don't we wait for him?

89
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,620
Seita. I've been looking for you.
Are you okay?

90
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:00,431
My mom...?

91
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,620
This way.

92
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:12,331
This IS your mother's, isn't it?

93
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,212
In here.

94
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:31,063
She's finally asleep.

95
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:39,423
She really should be
in a proper hospital.

96
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:44,433
I think Kaisei hospital
in Nishinomiya wasn't hit.

97
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:50,503
My mother has heart trouble.
Can she get her medicine?

98
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:52,644
I'll ask.

99
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:57,734
I'll be around if you need me.

100
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:04,644
Mom...

101
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:27,387
You saw her?

102
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:28,096
Yes.

103
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,315
It's terrible.

104
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:32,717
I'm thirsty.

105
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:40,236
If there's anything I can do,
just ask.

106
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:45,048
Oh, did you get
your biscuit ration yet?

107
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:47,457
I'll get it for you!

108
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:02,588
Keep this ring in your purse.
Don't lose it.

109
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:07,438
Mom's hurt.
She'll get better, though.

110
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:10,599
Where is she?

111
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,948
In the hospital. In Nishinomiya.

112
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,500
We'll stay here
at the school tonight.

113
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:25,460
Then tomorrow we'll go to our
aunt's place in Nishinomiya.

114
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:28,269
Okay?

115
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,700
We'll all be on the second floor.
Why don't you stop by later?

116
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:49,141
Thanks a lot. We will.

117
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,102
See you later, Setsuko.

118
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,032
Want some?

119
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,001
I want to see Mama.

120
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,010
Maybe tomorrow.
It's too late now.

121
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:58,036
Watch me, I'm good at this!

122
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:26,479
We haven't unbandaged her.
You don't want to see the body.

123
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,516
With this heat we're having,
she'll have to go on the truck today.

124
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:49,466
Where's your sister?

125
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,603
In Nishinomiya.
We have a distant aunt there.

126
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,821
I think she'll take care of us.

127
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:58,169
I see. Lucky for you.

128
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,537
I'd better get back to work.
Good luck to you.

129
00:21:30,183 --> 00:21:31,692
Mama!

130
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:34,480
Where is she?

131
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,699
Is she still sick?

132
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,967
Yeah. Still sick.

133
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,566
Welcome back.

134
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:47,072
How's your mother?
Is she at Kaisei?

135
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:51,789
Lucky your dad's in the Navy.

136
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:54,758
You get to have a truck
help move you over here!

137
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:59,375
I've laid out futons and
mosquito netting in your room.

138
00:21:59,606 --> 00:22:00,745
Thanks.

139
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:12,837
Doesn't Mama need her ring?

140
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,744
Did she give it to me?

141
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,000
Just be careful
you don't lose it.

142
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:32,495
Mom's...

143
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:38,151
When Mom's a little better,
I'll take you to see her.

144
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,598
Time for bed. Okay?

145
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:43,344
Dried bonito, herring,
dried potato, eggs, and pickled plums.

146
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:46,662
And I do believe this is butter!

147
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,478
You can't get these
for ANYTHING nowadays.

148
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,187
Soldiers always get the best
at times like these.

149
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:59,045
Anyway, did you
stop by the hospital?

150
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:03,601
I'd like to tell your mother
what's been happening.

151
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,240
And I could take Setsuko along
to visit her.

152
00:25:08,688 --> 00:25:09,917
That bad?!

153
00:25:10,528 --> 00:25:13,346
Mom died while she was
still at the school.

154
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,175
What?! She's dead!

155
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:24,149
Then why didn't you tell me?
Why were you hiding it?!

156
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,328
I didn't want Setsuko to know.

157
00:25:28,316 --> 00:25:30,115
Dead...

158
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,455
How awful!

159
00:25:33,263 --> 00:25:36,411
You'd best write your father
and tell him!

160
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:43,977
Nii-chan!

161
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:47,584
Look!
She bought me new shoes!

162
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:51,352
Good for you, Setsuko.

163
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:52,791
Hello there!

164
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,137
You poor dears.

165
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:15,228
Thanks.

166
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:21,364
What's that?

167
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,952
Bullfrogs.
Nothing to be scared of.

168
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,200
Firefly!

169
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:37,094
Try to catch it.

170
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:44,160
Whoops! Squashed it.

171
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,688
Ew! It smells!

172
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:48,437
You squeezed too hard.

173
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,579
There're millions of them!

174
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,968
Setsuko, close your eyes
and say "ah."

175
00:27:36,078 --> 00:27:37,267
Why?

176
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:39,555
Just do it. "Ah."

177
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,349
Fruit drop!

178
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,850
Fruit drop! Fruit drop!

179
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:11,292
I almost swallowed it.

180
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:28,517
We're home.

181
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:29,818
Where were you?

182
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,568
Did you thank the lady?

183
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:36,119
Yes.

184
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,020
That food looked good.

185
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:13,617
Seita. Shouldn't you be
going to school?

186
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,137
Or something?

187
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:20,148
Yeah, but the steelworks
they had me working in was bombed.

188
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,779
And my school burned down.
There's no place to go.

189
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:27,750
Well, I hope
you've written to your father.

190
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,311
I already sent a letter
through the Naval Office.

191
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,331
When?

192
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,082
Just after we came here.
About 10 days ago?

193
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,662
That's strange.

194
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:41,113
There should have been
a reply by now.

195
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:45,733
Return the scissors when you've
finished with them, Setsuko.

196
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:56,447
How's the war effort?

197
00:29:56,856 --> 00:29:58,617
It's starting to look hopeless.

198
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:04,298
The more factories we lose,
the harder the others have to work.

199
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:07,799
We're getting ready for
when they finally invade.

200
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:13,519
You're right. That's why food's
getting so hard to find.

201
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,001
Our soldiers aren't the only ones
who are suffering.

202
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:23,762
You work for our country's
defense too, young lady.

203
00:30:24,142 --> 00:30:27,103
You eat up and work
as hard as you can!

204
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:36,176
Not again.

205
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,495
So you've taken in
a couple of homeless children?

206
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:45,657
Poor things. To lose their
mother when they're so young.

207
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,197
What's wrong? Itch?

208
00:30:48,297 --> 00:30:51,827
It's hot. I hate shelters!

209
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:54,789
Just hang on. Don't worry,
I'm here for you.

210
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:07,411
Wanna go to the beach?

211
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:09,992
Yeah! Yeah! Let's go!

212
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:28,287
It's all vegetable fields now.

213
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:28,550
What're they doing?

214
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,710
Making sea salt.

215
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,721
It's because all the salt
and soy sauce is rationed.

216
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:37,182
Hurry up, Setsuko!

217
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,239
It might be a little cold.

218
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:10,029
Cold!

219
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:13,939
Feels good, right?
You won't itch now.

220
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:25,012
It's a big bathtub!

221
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:26,673
Hey!

222
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,124
Come back here!

223
00:33:39,605 --> 00:33:42,416
Grrr, I'm a bear!
I'm gonna eat you!

224
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:09,483
Snip... Snip... Snip...

225
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,693
What's wrong?
Is he sleeping?

226
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:27,166
Don't look at that.

227
00:34:30,476 --> 00:34:33,177
When it gets a little warmer,
I'll teach you how to swim.

228
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,818
We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.

229
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,459
<i>We'll swim,
and that'll make us hungry.</i>

230
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:55,802
<i>Seita-san!</i>

231
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:59,333
<i>Setsuko! Come on!</i>

232
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:07,605
<i>You're hungry, aren't you?</i>

233
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:11,176
<i>There's food here for you.</i>

234
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:47,053
Mother! Were you waiting long?
It's good to see you again.

235
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,143
Are you alright here?

236
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:51,135
I'm fine. Don't worry!

237
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:52,614
They're very nice here.

238
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,565
I'm hungry.

239
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:59,536
Let's get home
before we're caught in the raid.

240
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:03,316
I'm tired. Carry me.

241
00:36:05,426 --> 00:36:06,927
Air raid!

242
00:36:18,098 --> 00:36:21,988
Your mother won't be needing
her kimonos anymore.

243
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:24,129
Why don't you trade them
for some rice.

244
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:29,539
I've been trading off my things
bit by bit for food.

245
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:33,029
<i>You can probably get
a full toh of rice for them.</i>

246
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:34,539
That much?

247
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,229
You need your nourishment.

248
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,190
You can't be a soldier
if you don't grow up healthy.

249
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,380
<i>A whole toh of rice?</i>

250
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:46,420
Your mother would be glad
you didn't just let them go to waste.

251
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,310
Why don't I take them?

252
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,780
NO!

253
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:53,741
Setsuko. You're awake?

254
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:58,181
No! No! They're Mama's!

255
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,360
They're Mama's!
Don't take them!

256
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,491
- Setsuko. Let them go!
- They're Mama's!

257
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:04,772
Mama's!

258
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,900
NO! NO...!

259
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:07,942
NO...!

260
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:10,292
- Setsuko.
- NO! NO...!

261
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:12,701
- Setsuko.
- NO! NO...!

262
00:37:12,702 --> 00:37:13,522
Setsuko.

263
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:15,462
<i>Setsuko.</i>

264
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:20,473
<i>NO! NO...!</i>

265
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,855
Fine rice, isn't it?

266
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,545
We'll have a proper
rice dinner tonight, Setsuko.

267
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:03,335
Here, this is yours.

268
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:13,177
White rice, Setsuko!

269
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:26,167
Here you go.

270
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,847
With my daughter and our lodger
working overtime so much...

271
00:38:30,848 --> 00:38:33,188
I've felt bad
not having rice to give them.

272
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,469
It's great, huh?
Real white rice!

273
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,589
More!

274
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:44,528
Yes, yes.

275
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,090
You're just gobbling it down
tonight, aren't you, Setsuko?

276
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,690
Yes. It's good!

277
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,430
What's wrong?

278
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,091
I don't want rice porridge!

279
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:05,740
Don't we have
any more pickled plums?

280
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,781
We finished those off ages ago.

281
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,481
Here's your lunch.

282
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:12,781
Thanks. I'd better get going.

283
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:13,801
See you.

284
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:19,111
- Bye.
- Take care.

285
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:22,662
We'll have rice balls for lunch.
Just hold on 'til then.

286
00:39:22,762 --> 00:39:26,172
Stop that!
You'll have it for lunch too!

287
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:29,982
You think
a lazy slug like you deserves...

288
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:33,683
the same as people
who work for our nation?!

289
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:41,293
Seita-san, you're old enough to know
everyone has to cooperate.

290
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:45,714
You keep saying you want rice,
but do you earn it?

291
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:48,124
No, you absolutely do not!

292
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:02,445
I even give you some rice,
and you still complain!

293
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:05,436
But it's our rice.

294
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:08,795
Oh, so now
I'm cheating you, am I?

295
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:14,726
How dare you say that!
After I take you two in!

296
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:16,516
Fine!

297
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:21,847
We'll just make our
OWN dinners from now on!

298
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:26,336
Seita, you have other relatives
in Tokyo, don't you?

299
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:29,738
On your mother's side of the family?

300
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:35,338
Why not write to them?
WE could be bombed any day!

301
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:37,507
Problem is,
I don't know their address.

302
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:48,378
Let's go home.

303
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:50,849
Uh-huh. Papa's waiting for us.

304
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:56,549
Frogs are singing,
it's time to go home

305
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:02,670
Sorry you had to wait so long.

306
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,830
What's wrong?

307
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:11,890
I'm hungry.
And I'm thirsty too.

308
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,401
Okay.

309
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,901
Here, have a fruit drop.

310
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:23,792
Mom has 7000 yen in the bank.

311
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:30,532
7000. That's enough to live on,
so don't worry.

312
00:41:32,602 --> 00:41:38,053
I'm telling Dad to write back soon,
because you're waiting.

313
00:41:47,823 --> 00:41:49,794
You're in luck.

314
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:55,004
You can't buy a stove
like this easily nowadays.

315
00:41:55,285 --> 00:42:01,365
It's almost impossible to find
any hardware to sell.

316
00:42:03,535 --> 00:42:07,904
I'll take that comb, and...
Do you have an umbrella?

317
00:42:08,014 --> 00:42:10,685
An umbrella... Oh, yes!

318
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:15,405
It's raining, it's raining

319
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:21,256
Big brother's coming home
with an umbrella just for me

320
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:25,486
Drip-drop, plip-plop
Down the rain comes!

321
00:42:37,757 --> 00:42:39,467
That's got it!

322
00:42:39,477 --> 00:42:41,308
Be careful with that fire.

323
00:42:41,348 --> 00:42:42,027
Right.

324
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:47,428
What are they up to?

325
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:50,438
They're doing their own cooking.

326
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:54,389
Good for them!
More, please.

327
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,399
Mother,
did you scold them again?

328
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:00,669
Yes, but they refuse to apologize.

329
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:04,659
And that boy even bought a stove.
Just to spite me!

330
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:07,329
Finished!

331
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,961
Bad manners, Nii-chan.

332
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,510
Doesn't matter.
We can sit any way we want.

333
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:30,951
Rice for two.

334
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:32,392
That's it?

335
00:43:32,552 --> 00:43:35,502
Next ration will be in July.

336
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,970
Let me!

337
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:39,733
Like it?

338
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:49,583
It's all different tastes!

339
00:45:49,864 --> 00:45:53,474
Grape, strawberry, melon, mint.
All in there. Drink it all.

340
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:55,525
Drink it all, Setsuko.

341
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:08,037
All gone.

342
00:46:11,177 --> 00:46:15,188
Great.
Left the dishes for me to do.

343
00:46:15,717 --> 00:46:17,678
So selfish.

344
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:20,778
Honestly!
Those brats are two of the worst!

345
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:23,818
Not again!

346
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:25,808
Mama!

347
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:29,960
Seita-san, my daughter and
that man work for our nation!

348
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:32,900
We can't have her crying
keeping them awake.

349
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:38,740
We've enough trouble
getting sleep with the air raids!

350
00:47:05,624 --> 00:47:08,854
Report from
Central Military Division.

351
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:14,005
Several waves of
enemy bombers are approaching.

352
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:16,876
<i>Going to the shelter again, Seita-san?</i>

353
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:21,456
<i>You're old enough to
help fight the fires, aren't you?</i>

354
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:38,228
I want to go home.
I hate living with her!

355
00:47:40,518 --> 00:47:42,809
We don't have a house
to go back to.

356
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:55,820
With a great big streamer
shaped like a carp...

357
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:03,911
...and longer than a house

358
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:10,553
The big one's the Papa,
the little one's the kids.

359
00:48:10,652 --> 00:48:11,643
Stop it!

360
00:48:12,282 --> 00:48:14,943
Don't you realize
there's a war going on?!

361
00:48:14,973 --> 00:48:17,514
You two are nothing
but trouble for me!

362
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:22,544
A couple of pests,
that's what you are!

363
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:25,584
You're no help at all
during the raids.

364
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:29,375
You could just go and LIVE in
that shelter for all I care!

365
00:48:33,525 --> 00:48:34,425
That's it.

366
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,586
We'll live here.

367
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:45,417
No one uses it. It's sturdy.
We can live like we want!

368
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:48,258
Can we really live here?!

369
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:15,681
We've bothered you long enough.
We're leaving now.

370
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:18,491
Leaving? For where?

371
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:20,502
Haven't really decided yet.

372
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:24,932
Well, take care of yourselves.

373
00:49:25,642 --> 00:49:27,103
Bye-bye, Setsuko!

374
00:49:47,174 --> 00:49:49,346
This'll be the kitchen!

375
00:49:51,696 --> 00:49:53,467
This'll be the front door!

376
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:58,797
Where's the bathroom?

377
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:03,048
That can be anywhere.
Wanna go somewhere with me?

378
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:14,829
Thanks for the wagon.

379
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:17,159
Just leave it there.

380
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:24,460
Do you think you can sell us
some food and straw?

381
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,071
I guess.
Not much left, though.

382
00:51:22,868 --> 00:51:25,617
- My mouth's watering!
- Man, am I hungry.

383
00:51:52,531 --> 00:51:55,231
Well, we can always eat frogs.

384
00:51:55,232 --> 00:51:56,372
Frogs?

385
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,172
They're great.

386
00:52:02,213 --> 00:52:04,904
You'd better get
under the mosquito net.

387
00:52:14,684 --> 00:52:15,755
What's wrong?

388
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:18,235
I forgot my toothbrush.

389
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:20,515
One night without it
won't matter.

390
00:52:24,006 --> 00:52:27,376
It's getting buggy.
You'd better get under the net.

391
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,857
It's dark in there. I'm scared.

392
00:52:35,627 --> 00:52:38,259
I have to take a leak.
How about you?

393
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:45,038
A kamikaze.

394
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,820
It looks like a firefly.

395
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:48,919
Yeah.

396
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:53,130
Let's catch some.

397
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,650
Okay, get in.

398
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:12,182
I can see you!

399
00:53:12,462 --> 00:53:13,742
I can see you, too.

400
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:18,603
A hair clip.

401
00:53:23,853 --> 00:53:27,094
Okay, let's get
as many as we can!

402
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:25,225
I went to a naval review once.
Before you were born.

403
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:27,001
Naval review?

404
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:32,300
Uh-huh. Dad's cruiser, the "Maya,"
was in formation with the fleet.

405
00:55:09,919 --> 00:55:13,833
Mighty fortresses
floating on the seas

406
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:17,748
Defending our homeland
from invaders near and far

407
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:19,292
Enemy plane!

408
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:33,502
I wonder
where Dad is fighting now.

409
00:56:03,054 --> 00:56:05,703
Get off me, Nii-chan!

410
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:45,040
Whatcha doing?

411
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:50,649
Making a grave.
Mama's in a grave too.

412
00:56:55,296 --> 00:56:57,975
Auntie told me.

413
00:56:58,306 --> 00:57:03,132
She said Mama died,
and she's in a grave now.

414
00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:35,524
We'll visit her grave sometime.

415
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:40,773
Do you remember the graveyard,
the one near Nunobiki?

416
00:57:41,465 --> 00:57:47,014
That's where she is.
Under a big camphor tree.

417
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:50,377
Why do fireflies
have to die so soon?

418
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,880
Hey, it looks like
somebody's living here.

419
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,105
Probably lost their house.

420
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,095
Maybe it's some crazy hermit.

421
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,477
It's a swing.

422
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:42,055
A kid lives here.
What's this?

423
00:58:42,748 --> 00:58:44,705
Rest in Peace!

424
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:49,190
Wish it was real food.

425
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:51,408
"Setsuko."

426
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,763
It says "Setsuko."

427
00:58:52,803 --> 00:58:55,100
Look! Dried frogs!

428
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:57,017
Who'd wanna eat that?!

429
00:58:57,268 --> 00:59:01,764
Nobody I know
would ever eat this stuff!

430
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,114
Ground soybeans!

431
00:59:05,115 --> 00:59:07,583
And I thought
the food I got was bad!

432
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:09,139
A ghost!

433
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:25,797
I've traded everything for rice.
Even my mom's kimono.

434
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:26,890
There's nothing left to trade.

435
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,741
Please, I can pay you money
for the rice.

436
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,758
Sorry. I can't trade
or sell anything to you.

437
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:39,224
I'm a farmer, but even
I don't have any rice to share.

438
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,987
Don't you have other relatives?

439
00:59:49,097 --> 00:59:51,055
I can't contact them.

440
00:59:51,576 --> 00:59:55,049
Then take my advice
and go back to that woman.

441
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:58,590
Everything's rationed now.

442
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:01,099
You can't survive
outside of the system.

443
01:00:02,423 --> 01:00:05,203
Just swallow your pride
and apologize to her.

444
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,185
Thanks, anyway.
I'll ask someone else.

445
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:19,824
You're a navy man's son, right?
Try to be brave.

446
01:00:51,975 --> 01:00:53,250
Should we?

447
01:01:33,108 --> 01:01:33,901
Uh-oh!

448
01:02:35,503 --> 01:02:38,353
It doesn't matter
if you like it or not.

449
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:39,497
You have to eat!

450
01:02:39,577 --> 01:02:40,883
You need to, so you can grow up!

451
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:43,341
Nii-chan...

452
01:02:45,449 --> 01:02:49,905
I-I feel funny.

453
01:02:50,255 --> 01:02:51,339
Are you cold?

454
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:55,354
I've been having diarrhea.

455
01:03:00,624 --> 01:03:02,355
Why you...!

456
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:07,144
I'm sorry!

457
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:11,254
Sir, forgive me!
I didn't mean to.

458
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:15,354
My sister's sick. I just wanted
to get her some sugar!

459
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:18,515
Yeah, sure! Stealing food's
a serious crime in wartime!

460
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:23,385
You god damned...!
Come back here!

461
01:03:34,276 --> 01:03:37,505
What the hell?!
Potatoes too?!

462
01:03:37,986 --> 01:03:41,136
So YOU'RE the one who's
been stealing around here!

463
01:03:41,216 --> 01:03:42,056
Nii-chan!

464
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:47,666
I'm sorry!
I'll never do it again, I swear!

465
01:03:47,716 --> 01:03:50,306
Tell it to the cops!
I'll take you there myself!

466
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:54,327
- Now walk!
I hope they lock you up!

467
01:03:54,328 --> 01:03:56,076
- Nii-chan!
- Nii-chan!

468
01:03:56,517 --> 01:03:58,437
Please, she's sick!
She needs me!

469
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:00,926
Nii-chan!

470
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:03,607
Nii-chan!

471
01:04:05,737 --> 01:04:07,207
Nii-chan...

472
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:08,727
Nii-chan...

473
01:04:14,127 --> 01:04:19,258
The nature of the crime is
fairly clear, I think.

474
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:21,988
Thank you, I'll handle this.
You may go.

475
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:23,778
But, officer...

476
01:04:24,497 --> 01:04:27,118
You've knocked
this poor kid around enough.

477
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,718
I'm even tempted to call it...

478
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:33,118
...ASSAULT!

479
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,179
I... er... Thank you, officer!

480
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:42,268
They hit Fukui tonight.

481
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:47,878
Would you like a glass of water?

482
01:04:57,999 --> 01:04:59,039
Setsuko.

483
01:05:07,149 --> 01:05:08,610
Nii-chan!

484
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,470
Nii-chan.

485
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:39,391
Where does it hurt?
Should I get a doctor?

486
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,161
Setsuko!

487
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:57,751
Seita, I have to
go to the bathroom.

488
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:03,131
Can it wait?

489
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:03,782
Yes.

490
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:05,491
Hop on.

491
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:19,972
Nii-san is gone to the mountain
to bring back some firewood...

492
01:07:09,504 --> 01:07:11,084
Setsuko. Dinner.

493
01:07:15,045 --> 01:07:19,565
This pumpkin's great.
Tastes just like sweet bean jelly.

494
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:22,784
Don't like that stuff.

495
01:07:22,824 --> 01:07:27,595
Look, if you don't eat,
Dad'll blame ME for it.

496
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:31,054
Come on, I'll even help you.
Now cheer up and eat!

497
01:07:33,795 --> 01:07:37,606
Once you get better,
I'll take you to the beach again.

498
01:09:14,178 --> 01:09:16,750
Now I'll really get you
something good to eat, Setsuko!

499
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,979
Nii-chan...

500
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,681
Nii-chan...

501
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:42,169
These were your mother's?
Don't make me laugh!

502
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:45,211
Don't try to pawn off
this garbage on me!

503
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,710
Setsuko.

504
01:09:57,501 --> 01:09:58,341
Setsuko!

505
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:37,793
Nii-chan... Water...

506
01:10:48,463 --> 01:10:49,583
Breathe in.

507
01:10:50,743 --> 01:10:51,413
And out.

508
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:58,304
She's been having diarrhea
for a while now.

509
01:10:58,873 --> 01:11:04,243
Prickly heat, rashes...
And salt water hurts her skin.

510
01:11:07,203 --> 01:11:11,994
Weakening from malnutrition.
Probably due to the diarrhea.

511
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,303
Next?

512
01:11:13,304 --> 01:11:15,303
Can you give her medicine?
A shot?

513
01:11:15,554 --> 01:11:17,184
Don't wanna shot.

514
01:11:17,724 --> 01:11:21,144
Please, doctor, help her!

515
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:26,964
Medicine?
All this child needs is food.

516
01:11:26,965 --> 01:11:28,544
Food...

517
01:11:29,514 --> 01:11:30,504
What's wrong?!

518
01:11:30,945 --> 01:11:32,765
Where do I GET food?!

519
01:12:21,997 --> 01:12:26,206
Boy, am I hungry.
What do you want to eat?

520
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:31,895
Tempura, sashimi, jelly...

521
01:12:32,195 --> 01:12:33,276
Anything else?

522
01:12:33,455 --> 01:12:35,255
Ice cream.

523
01:12:36,135 --> 01:12:37,404
And also...

524
01:12:38,074 --> 01:12:40,354
I want fruit drops.

525
01:12:40,734 --> 01:12:41,974
Drops? Okay!

526
01:12:47,183 --> 01:12:50,873
I'll withdraw the money and
buy you all the food you need.

527
01:12:51,763 --> 01:12:55,893
Don't want anything.
You can't have it.

528
01:12:56,483 --> 01:13:02,491
Don't go! Stay with me!
Don't leave me alone!

529
01:13:02,872 --> 01:13:04,642
Don't worry, Setsuko.

530
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:09,401
I'll buy you some good,
nourishing food.

531
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:14,951
And I'll never leave you again.
Never, ever again.

532
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,639
I promise.

533
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:42,207
3000 yen.

534
01:13:42,358 --> 01:13:44,107
There's a typhoon coming?

535
01:13:44,398 --> 01:13:49,706
Great, we get our "divine wind"
AFTER we surrender. Figures...

536
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:52,326
Surrender? We've lost the war?!

537
01:13:53,316 --> 01:13:54,876
Haven't you heard?

538
01:13:58,906 --> 01:14:02,565
Japan's lost?
The Great Japanese Empire?

539
01:14:02,595 --> 01:14:03,305
Yeah.

540
01:14:03,555 --> 01:14:05,165
Surrendered unconditionally.

541
01:14:06,785 --> 01:14:08,703
What about the fleet?

542
01:14:08,704 --> 01:14:09,634
All gone.

543
01:14:09,635 --> 01:14:13,423
Sent to the bottom.
Not one left afloat.

544
01:14:13,424 --> 01:14:14,334
WHAT?!

545
01:14:14,394 --> 01:14:18,782
Was my Dad's ship sunken, too?!
Is that why he hasn't written?!

546
01:14:18,783 --> 01:14:20,993
How should I know?

547
01:14:21,773 --> 01:14:23,563
Crazy kid.

548
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,682
Damn father!

549
01:14:45,931 --> 01:14:47,430
I'm so hungry.

550
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,030
Dad.

551
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,869
Now Dad's gone too.

552
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:07,039
He's dead too.

553
01:15:09,328 --> 01:15:10,278
Dad...

554
01:15:54,702 --> 01:15:58,622
Sorry I'm so late.
I'll make you some rice.

555
01:15:59,123 --> 01:16:00,622
Up they go.

556
01:16:02,712 --> 01:16:04,961
And down again.

557
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:10,361
Oh. Firefly's stopped.

558
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:12,741
I bought us
some chicken and eggs.

559
01:16:15,591 --> 01:16:16,730
And also...

560
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,709
Setsuko, what's in your mouth?!

561
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,089
This is a marble.
It isn't a drop!

562
01:16:37,689 --> 01:16:41,708
I brought you something
I know you like.

563
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,736
Nii-chan. Have one.

564
01:16:52,356 --> 01:16:53,937
Setsuko. What's?

565
01:16:54,546 --> 01:16:55,935
Rice balls.

566
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:01,015
I made them for you.

567
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:06,145
Here. Have one.

568
01:17:10,164 --> 01:17:12,154
You don't want them?

569
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:13,854
Setsuko!

570
01:17:25,332 --> 01:17:29,292
Look, it's a watermelon.
I didn't steal it, either.

571
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:41,351
Here, eat it.

572
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,320
It's good...

573
01:17:55,769 --> 01:17:59,419
Hold on, I'll make you some
rice gruel with eggs.

574
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:09,127
I'll leave the melon here for you.

575
01:18:10,908 --> 01:18:11,598
Okay?

576
01:18:13,157 --> 01:18:14,637
Nii-chan.

577
01:18:15,777 --> 01:18:17,527
Thank you.

578
01:18:42,354 --> 01:18:45,644
<i>She never woke up.</i>

579
01:19:38,268 --> 01:19:41,007
There.
Charcoal for the cremation.

580
01:19:41,638 --> 01:19:45,177
Since it's a child,
you should do it at a temple.

581
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:49,947
The body should be lightly dressed.
Use beanstalks for a good fire.

582
01:19:50,676 --> 01:19:53,376
Beautiful day,
in spite of it all.

583
01:19:58,665 --> 01:20:01,403
It hasn't changed a bit.

584
01:20:01,404 --> 01:20:03,795
It's good to be home!

585
01:20:06,874 --> 01:20:10,534
Look!
The old phonograph.

586
01:20:13,803 --> 01:20:17,173
I've missed this view.

587
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:04,586
<i>Come back soon!</i>

588
01:24:42,459 --> 01:24:45,597
<i>The next morning,
I put some of Setsuko's ashes into...</i>

589
01:24:45,598 --> 01:24:48,378
<i>...the candy tin,
and then climbed down the hill.</i>

590
01:24:49,578 --> 01:24:51,537
<i>I never went back to the shelter.</i>

591
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:00,647
<i>Nii-chan...</i>

592
01:25:17,934 --> 01:25:19,604
Time for bed. Okay?
